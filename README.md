TwitterStreaming
================

Python script to mine Twitter using Twython and the Twitter Streaming API. This script will mine based on a keyword ("E Cigarettes" in this case).
OAuth credentials will need to be supplied. This is a work in progress and while it works for the most part, I am sure there are
improvements that could be made. I would like to explore getting status ids so that if there is a disconnect I can backfill data. Presently this is  not
working.
